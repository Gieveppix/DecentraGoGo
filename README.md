  - Achieving stretch goals unlocks new features, rewards, or project enhancements.

### 3. Deadline Extensions Contract

  - Community members vote on proposed extensions.
  - If approved by the majority, campaign deadlines are extended, providing more time to reach goals.

## How It Works

DecentraGoGo simplifies the crowdfunding process while adding powerful features:

### 1. Creating a Campaign

- A user (campaign creator) deploys a Crowdfunding Contract, specifying the fundraising goal and deadline.
- Contributors send Ether to the campaign address to support the project.
- Campaign details, including contributions, are transparently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

### 2. Setting Stretch Goals

- The campaign creator utilizes the Stretch Goals Contract to set additional funding milestones and their descriptions.
- Stretch goals can represent project enhancements, new features, or additional rewards for backers.
- As contributions reach target amounts, stretch goals are marked as achieved, signaling progress to the community.

### 3. Proposing Deadline Extensions

- Campaign creators or contributors have the option to propose deadline extensions.
- Reasons for extensions are provided, such as unforeseen challenges or the need for more time to meet goals.
- Community members, including contributors, vote on whether to approve the extension request.
- If approved by the majority, the campaign's deadline is extended, granting more time for fundraising.

### 4. Contributions and Refunds

- Contributors send Ether directly to campaign addresses.
- If the campaign does not reach its funding goal within the initial deadline, contributors have the option to request refunds.
- Refund requests are processed through the Crowdfunding Contract, ensuring a transparent and fair refund process.

## Interactions

- **Creators:** Campaign creators set stretch goals and propose deadline extensions to improve campaign flexibility.
- **Contributors:** Contributors provide financial support to campaigns and vote on proposed deadline extensions.
- **Stretch Goals:** Automated tracking and achievement of stretch goals based on contribution milestones.
- **Deadline Extensions:** Extensions are approved through community consensus, enabling campaigns to adapt to changing circumstances.

DecentraGoGo facilitates a collaborative and transparent crowdfunding ecosystem, empowering creators to achieve their goals and contributors to shape the future of projects they support.
