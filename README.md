## How It Works

DecentraGoGo simplifies the crowdfunding process while adding powerful features:

### 1. Creating a Campaign

- Contributors send Ether to the campaign address to support the project.
- Campaign details, including contributions, are transparently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

### 2. Setting Stretch Goals

- The campaign creator utilizes the Stretch Goals Contract to set additional funding milestones and their descriptions.
- Stretch goals can represent project enhancements, new features, or additional rewards for backers.
- As contributions reach target amounts, stretch goals are marked as achieved, signaling progress to the community.

### 3. Proposing Deadline Extensions

- Campaign creators or contributors have the option to propose deadline extensions.
- Reasons for extensions are provided, such as unforeseen challenges or the need for more time to meet goals.
- Community members, including contributors, vote on whether to approve the extension request.

### 4. Sharing Project Updates

- Contributors can access and view project updates to enhance transparency and engagement.

### 5. Contributions and Refunds
